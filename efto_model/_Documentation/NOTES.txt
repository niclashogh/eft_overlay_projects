TODO

	MUST HAVE:
- Update Maps, Traders & Banners (./Resources)
- Remake MenuTabs (MainWindow.xaml)
- Update all UserControls & Add one for 'Key'
- Make 'Keybind' UserControl open i a seperat window and minimize it when opening other tabs + Reopening. (If it can be controlled and closed from Main VM)
- Add 'Reset entire Quest progression' button and other quick-access elements to Setting_Home UserControl
- On Settings 'Preview' UserControls add forms for creating, removing & updating (Quest: MultiChoices & Dependencies) ?+ (AccessKey: Quest Dependencies)
- 

	NICE TO HAVE:
- New Tab with (EFT to Realtime convertion (7 sec to 1) with visual alert?) + (RUB, USD & EURO Converter)
- Hideout interactive visualization and upgrade cost for each station and level

	LOW PRIORITY:
- Add Import/Export of Keybinds (.json file) between the game and this.
